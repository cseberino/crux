Crux

a minimal Lisp variant

One of the simplest practical programming languages is Lisp. All components are
atoms or lists. Atom include booleans, integers, strings, variables and
functions. Lists can contain other lists.

Evaluating atoms, except for variables, returns them. Evaluating variables
involves environments. Evaluating lists involves function invocations. Some
function invocations involve special evaluation procedures.

The following functions are always in the environment.  The first four functions
involve special evaluation procedures:

        noeval
        if
        def
        func
        macro
        atom
        equal
        first
        rest
        append
        add
        negate
        gt

See the source code and other Lisp resources for further details.
